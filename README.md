# no-beta-projects
Make github reroute the projects button to the standard projects(not the new beta ones)
## Installation
To install, simply download the files, go to google chrome, go to the manage extensions page, hit load unpacked, and load from the src folder and you're done.
### NOTICE:
Github has removed support for the old version of projects on repos that were created after the new version has been realized, meaning this project will create an error if you try to open the projects tab on one of those aforementioned repos. I will be trying to figure out a way to get around this but for now it's probably best to disable the extension
